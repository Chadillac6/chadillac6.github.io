                <h3>Birdie Pot 🐦</h3>
                <p>During the regular season, Seneca Open, and Championship Weekend, for every birdie a member scores, every member adds $0.50 to the birdie pot.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>50% of pot</strong>: Last person to card a birdie throughout the season</li>

            <section class="rule-section">
                <h3>Golf Rules</h3>
                
                <h4>Get Approvals</h4>
                <p>When in doubt, ask one other person for approval. This applies to gimmies, ball replacements, and anything else not outlined below.</p>

                <h4>Breakfast Buffet</h4>
                <p>If your first drive is not in the fairway, each player is allowed to hit a 2nd shot on the first tee and choose which ball to use. 1st swing only.</p>

                <h4>Gimmies</h4>
                <p>Gimmies are allowed as long as 1 other person approves the pick-up. <strong>No gimmies for pars or birdies</strong> - doesn't matter if someone says pick up.</p>

                <h4>No White Stakes</h4>
                <p>Each OOB can be played as a red stake. This means you can either drop 2 club lengths from where the ball went out OR you get a line from your previous shot to where the ball went OOB. Ball should never be progressed further to where the ball went.</p>

                <h4>Bumping / Plugged Balls / Wet Sandtraps</h4>
                <p><strong>No bumping or ball movement if the ball is in a hazard</strong> (red stakes, white stakes, water).</p>
                <p>Bumping is ok as long as your line is not improved and you stay on the same cut of grass. Think 2in radius. If you need to move your ball more, you must get approval from 1 other person. You cannot progress the ball and you cannot improve your line.</p>

                <h4>Gentleman Drops</h4>
                <p>If you cannot find your ball, you must have unanimous approval by the group to get a free drop.</p>

                <h4>Tie Breakers & Putt-Offs</h4>
                <p>Members with a tie will split the total points available. If there is a tie after the Seneca Open or Championship, a putt-off will take place.</p>

                <h4>Concedes</h4>
                <p>Pick up your ball once you are <strong>+4 for the hole</strong> to keep things moving. You can also pick up at any time to automatically get a +4.</p>

                <h4>Late To Your Round</h4>
                <p>If you are late to your round, you will concede (+4) any holes you missed. Groups should try to delay the start by letting others go first to minimize missed holes.</p>

                <h4>Incorrect Scores in 18Birdies</h4>
                <p>If a member inputs the incorrect score and starts to play the next hole, it is a <strong>2 stroke penalty</strong> and a warning. Three times during the season = DQ'd for the round (3 strikes you're out).</p>

                <h4>The Faro Rule (No Training Aids / Cheating)</h4>
                <p>No training aids, foreign substances, or non-PGA-approved equipment should be used during the round. Any illegal equipment can result in an auto DQ for the round and future penalties if deemed necessary.</p>
